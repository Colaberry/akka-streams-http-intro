/**
 * Emits elements with potentially duration between elements.
 * The duration between elements is determined by the supplied Duration iterator.
 * The purpose is to enable variable timing between elements to simulate real-world events that
 * may follow a statistical distribution (Poisson, for example).
 *
 * The scheduling algorithm is intentionally simple and does not attempt to perform adjustments to
 * match actual with desired element timing.
 * Scheduling is done using the Akka scheduler, so any caveats about timing regarding that scheduler
 * are applicable here.
